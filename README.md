# Dijkstra

This is a continuation of the code I have been writing for [rust_learning_notes hashmap practice](https://github.com/colelawrence/rust_learning_notes/tree/master/hm/).

At the moment, we still need to sort the found paths before searching and returning, because at this time, it is not taking weight into account.

The algorithm works if all weights are equal though!

_maybe we should just make artificial edges between real vertices equal to the weight..._
