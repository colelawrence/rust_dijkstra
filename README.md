# Dijkstra

The implementation is based on the description of Dijkstra's Algorithm as found in [the wonderful book, _Algorithms Unplugged_](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642153273) published by Springer.

At the moment, we still need to sort the found paths before searching and returning, because at this time, it is not taking weight into account.

The algorithm works if all weights are equal though!

_maybe we should just make artificial edges between real vertices equal to the weight..._
